# paste

A tiny pastebin alternative for self-hosting.

My goals with this project are as follows:

1. Learn rust by getting it wrong the first time on a low-stakes project
2. Keep the feature set small.

## Features / TODO List

- [ ] Read files from directory
- [ ] Write files to directory
- [ ] Configuration for directory (env variable)
- [ ] Simple bearer token authentication for creating new pastes
